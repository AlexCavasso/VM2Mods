Note the careers below that have conflicting talents.
===
[b]Bounty Hunter:[/b]
Choose between Buckshot or Double-shotted (the career skill modifiers) in the normal talent menu. Encore is always active.


[b]Waystalker:[/b]
In your mod settings menu (press F4 by default), you can change some properties of the regen passive, Amaranthe.

You can decide how much healing is done when it heals, the percentage of health it will heal to, how much ammo is regenerated (by the Vaul's Quiver talent), and whether or not allies regenerate that ammo.


[b]Ranger Veteran:[/b]
In your mod settings menu (press F4 by default), you can change some properties of the scavenge passive, Survivalist.

You can decide how often potions (Master Brewer talent) and bombs (Battle Brew talent) drop and if drops exclude each other.

When deciding on the defaults for the Waystalker and Ranger Veteran options, I considered the way the talents are written and the way their functionality was originally programmed. As such, I feel like the default settings provide the most 'authentic' all-talents mode.

However, because this really is a cheat mod anyway, I also decided to make them more configurable because I was already rewriting that code :)";
